1. Lifestyle - Dieting App
   - **Description**: A mobile database and tracker that allows users to follow the specific diet they want (intermittent fasting, keto, paleo, etc.). It will  provide meal recipes, restaurant recommendations in the area and lists of snacks/ingredients they can consume. It will also let users track their macros and calories while they're on the diet and provide recommendations on how they should continue/change depending on their goals for the diet. sls
   - **Category:** Health & Fitness
   - **Mobile:** Website and mobile will have similar features. More focused on mobile though because our users will most likely appreciate the ease of using their phone.
   - **Story:** 
   - **Market:** Health and fitness is really popular now. Anyone that is trying to live a healthier lifestyle or lose some weight can enjoy this app. Ability to follow and share users' diets will motivate and build a greater fitness community. 
   - **Habit:** Users can post and share their daily goals, recipes, results or personal tips online.
   - **Scope:** Starts off with as a personal fitness tracker but can build up to become an online fitness community where users can collaborate.
2. Mover (Moo-behrr)
   - **Description**: The only app you will need for anything transportation! Mover works in a way so that the user does not need to worry about 'how' or 'if' they will get to their destination, Mover makes transportation seamless. Unique features gives the user more ways to trip carefree! Peer-to-peer mechanic help, is a feature that drivers can use to get local, on-demand, mechanical help. 
   - **Category:** Transportation 
   - **Mobile:** In order to make transportation seamless, the user should be able to do what they need with a simple tap of a button, so mobile is not only essential, but is the preferred platform.
   - **Story:** Creates a way to make transportation a carefree experence for those who lives in urban and suburban areas. The nuances of driving,commuting,flying,parking,paying parking tickets, will become a thing of the past. 
   - **Market:** Car owners and non car oweners, daily commuters and seasoned travellers, city dwellers and suburban folk in all major cities across the globe can benefit from seamless transportation. Like commerce, transportation isn't a matter of choice, it is something all humans must do in oder to live, so naturally the market is large and varied. /*on avg American homes spend 18 cents on the dollar on transportation -- as of 2017 -- */
   - **Habit:** Those who rely on public transportation in cities to get to work, school, etc... will interact with the app on a daily basis to get an approximation when to leave their house to catch the next bus/train. Those residing outside cities will find themselves using Mover to check traffic flow, and book parking space hours before they get to their destination in the city. One of the main goals of Mover is: whenever someone needs to be somewhere, Mover will be the app to make their trip seamless.
   - **Scope:** Transporation is a large industry with many different forms to get from place to place. To start, Mover will not only give the user an approximation of bus/train arrivals, but will give a gentle alert when they should leave to catch their bus/train. Show traffic flow, parking availabilty, and allows user to hold parking space for a certain amount time before they arrive at their destination. Mover, later can offer peer-to-peer features such as the peer-to-peer car mechanic help, and allow user around the U.S. to pay for their parking tickets with a simple tap of the button.
